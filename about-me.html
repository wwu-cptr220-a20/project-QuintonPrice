                <p>
                    My name is Quinton Price. I'm 20 years old and from the Seattle area. I'm currently majoring in
                    Computer Science at Walla Walla University, where I will graduate in June of 2023. I enjoy biking,
                    skiing, cars, technology and nature.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Biking has always been a a huge part of my life. I have been biking since I can remember. In fact,
                    some of my earliest memories are falling off of my bike (which is probably not a good thing).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Growing up, my dad got me into mountain biking and took me out as often as he could. In his younger
                    years, and for some time while I was young, my dad raced mountain bikes recreationally. My family
                    would pile into our van and drive out to his races, with my mom and I setting up chairs to watch and
                    cheer as he rode past.
                </p>

                <p>Fast forward 14 or so years, and I still have the same passion for mountain biking that I did as a
                    kid (although I now have to fund it myself instead of relying on my dad to convince my mom a new
                    bike was "neccesary"). I frequently ride my local trails - Duthie Hill, Tiger Mountain and Swan
                    Creek. I enjoy jumps and flow, though technical riding has been something I have come to appreciate
                    more and plan to improve on in the future.</p>

                <p>In September of 2019, I bought a 2018 Trek Fuel Ex 8. While I enjyoed the bike, it did not have enough travel for the type of riding I enjoyed.</p>
