        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p>
            For my project, I plan to create a guide for mountain biking and hiking near Seattle. Mountain biking is a
            passion of mine, something I have grown up with. Often, when looking for new spots, it's hard to find a
            website that lists trails alongside pictures and detailed information about the ride.</p>

        <p> To solve this, I would like to create a website that can act as a travel guide for those coming to the area
            to bike. <a href="https://gearjunkie.com/evergreen-mountain-bike-alliance-washington-trails">Western
                Washington / British Columbia is a "mecca" for mountain biking</a>, and many people travel here
            with the sole purpose of experiencing local trails. Having a website that can serve as a guide would be
            useful to this demographic. </p>

        <p> My website would include articles (that serve as guides), pictures, a page where people can submit pictures
            / reviews of trails and more. I would like to implement a map application that shows the location of trails
            on said map, hopefully using Google Maps.</p>

        <h2> Applications </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                As stated previously, I would like to have a discussion area, somewhere where users can submit photos
                and reviews of trails. Especially in months with inclement weather, having recent reviews and pictures
                of
                trail conditions is extremely useful. It can make the difference between a fun and miserable day. I
                could also potentially include a <a href="https://weatherwidget.io/">weather widget</a> in every article
                that gives conditions for trails.
            </li>

            <li>
                I would also like to have a map feature which allows users to view locations of trails on
                an interactive map. This would give users the ability to browse trails in the region they intend to ride
                and, if paired with a service such as <a
                    href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map">Google
                    Maps</a>, potentially see nearby attractions.
            </li>

            <li> Additionally, it would be nice to have a service that reads a users' location and
                suggests rides near them. This is not neccesarily the same as the interactive map, as it would be in the
                form of a pop-up or link that leads them to articles about different rides.
            </li>
        </ul>
