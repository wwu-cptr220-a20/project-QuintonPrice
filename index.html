                <hr>
                <p> While there are hundreds of trail systems to ride in the Pacific Northwest, several stand out as
                    being
                    the most popular. </p>
                <p> Below is a brief list of the top rides in the PNW. For a more comprehensive list of rides, please
                    see
                    the "<a href="trails/trails.html">Trails</a>" page.

                    <p>
                        Undoubtedly the most famous bike park in the world, Whistler is situated about an hour north of
                        Vancouver, BC in Canada. Whistler has one of the most extensive and well-built trail systems in
                        the
                        world, with dozens of machine-built runs to boast. For this reason, tens of thousands of people
                        travel
                        out to the mountain biking mecca every summer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During the summer, Whistler opens to mountain biking. Whistler's climate is mild, and a
                        chairlift
                        adapted to fit bikes makes it easy for riderse to get up the mountain, allowing them to get in
                        as
                        many laps as
                        possible. Some famous trails from Whistler are A-Line, Dirt Merchant, and Too Tight.

                    <p>
                        Galbraith mountain is one of Washington's top mountain biking destination. It is located within
                        5
                        minutes of downtown, making it a perfect mountain for after-work rides. However, don't let it's
                        proximity to the city fool you: Galbraith boasts over 65 miles of trails, varying from technical
                        to
                        smooth singletrack.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Unlike Whistler, Galbraith has many hiking trails for locals to enjoy. Galbraith is divided into
                        two
                        sections, north and south. They both feature a rich variety of trails.It is not a bike-only
                        park,
                        though the majority of the mountain is built for mountain biking. Galbraith is famous for long,
                        punchy descents with technical features. It is good for intermediate and advanced riders, though
                        new
                        riders may find it intimidating. Famous lines at Galbraith include Unemployment Line and
                        Evolution.
